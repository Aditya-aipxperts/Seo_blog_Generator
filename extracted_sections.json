    "ExamplesSection": "## References, Examples, and Data Points\n\nThe video transcript provides several examples and data points related to building and scaling a quick food delivery service.\n\n### Validating the Idea: From Zero Orders to Overwhelming Demand\n\nInitially, Swish faced a significant challenge: a fully equipped cloud kitchen with no orders.\n\n*   **Example:** \"We had this beautiful cloud kitchen set up... We had everything in place but we were not getting orders at all.\"\n\nTo overcome this, Swish announced their service on social media.\n\n*   **Data Point:** They anticipated \"50 to 100 reactions\" and \"one or two people\" ordering.\n*   **Outcome:** The response far exceeded expectations, leading to so many orders that they needed extra help. \"We ended up having so many orders that the chefs and the riders felt limited and we had to call our friends and friends moms and all to come and help.\"\n\n*Visual Prompt: A before-and-after visual would work well here. The first image could show an empty kitchen with chefs waiting. The second could show a bustling kitchen with many people helping.*\n\n### Key Metrics: Delivery Time and Customer Behavior\n\nSwish's core value proposition is rapid delivery.\n\n*   **Primary Keyword:** **10-minute delivery**\n\n*   **Example:** \"Swish is a 10-minute food delivery platform.\" The transcript emphasizes the speed of delivery as a crucial factor. \"The speed at which Swiss delivers... swish has been very fast.\"\n\n*   **Data Point:** A real-time delivery test is shown, achieving a delivery time of \"7 minutes.\"\n\nThe video also highlights an interesting customer behavior pattern.\n\n*   **Secondary Keyword:** **Customer Retention**\n\n*   **Observation:** Despite initial skepticism (\"I don't need food in 10 minutes\"), customers repeatedly ordered from Swish.\n\n*Visual Prompt: A simple bar graph could illustrate the point about customer retention. The X-axis could be \"First Impression\" and \"Repeat Orders\". The Y-axis could be \"Number of Customers\". A comparison between people initially skeptical and the large repeat order numbers will make a great visual.*",
