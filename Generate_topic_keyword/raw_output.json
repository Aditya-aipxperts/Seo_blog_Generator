"**Output 1: Primary Keywords:** Generative AI, AI agents, Agentic AI, Large Language Models (LLM), AI applications\n\n**Output 2: Justification Primary:**\n\n* **Generative AI:** This keyword directly relates to the core topic, which is explaining the differences between generative AI, AI agents, and agentic AI.  The video extensively covers generative AI's capabilities, defining it as a system that generates new content (images, text, audio, video). Search intent is high for users seeking a basic understanding of generative AI.  The term is repeatedly emphasized throughout the video, establishing its contextual importance. While highly competitive, the video's focus on explaining the concept and its differences from other AI types could differentiate it, making it a strong choice.  No specific industry jargon is prominently featured within this term.\n\n* **AI agents:** This is a crucial keyword as the video contrasts AI agents with generative AI and agentic AI.  The explanation of AI agents as single-task performers using tools like APIs to access external data directly addresses a search intent for a clear definition. The speaker frequently uses the term to illustrate the concept in the context of LLM interaction. While competitive, the video offers a specific angle by detailing AI agent functionality within the broader AI landscape.  No specific industry jargon is prominently featured within this term.\n\n* **Agentic AI:** This is a key term differentiating the video\u2019s content. Search intent focuses on the advanced capabilities of agentic AI. The speaker clearly defines agentic AI as a system of collaborating AI agents, solving complex tasks, and highlighting its trending nature. This term is less competitive than others as it is a more advanced concept. No specific industry jargon is prominently featured within this term.\n\n* **Large Language Models (LLM):**  This is a core concept throughout the video.  The video explicitly uses LLMs as the foundational technology for both AI agents and agentic AI systems. Search intent is high as users researching AI often seek information on LLMs. The speaker utilizes this term constantly to explain the underlying technology.  While highly competitive, the video provides context within a specific area, distinguishing it from generic LLM tutorials. The term itself is industry-standard.\n\n* **AI applications:** This keyword broadens the scope slightly while remaining relevant. The video implicitly discusses AI applications as it explains the use cases of generative AI, AI agents, and agentic AI. Search intent is broad, targeting users seeking real-world examples of AI implementation.  The term's contextual importance lies in illustrating the practical implications of the discussed AI types.  While highly competitive, the focus on specific applications within the video can help it stand out.\n\n\n**Output 3: Secondary Keywords:**  Langchain, LangGraph, Llama Index, Generative AI applications, Multimodal AI\n\n\n**Output 4: Justification Secondary:**\n\n* **Langchain:** This complements the primary keywords by specifying a relevant library used in building AI agent applications. Search broadening is achieved by targeting developers and users specifically interested in Langchain\u2019s capabilities. User value is added by providing a practical tool mentioned within the context of the video. Strategic importance lies in attracting users searching for practical implementation guides.\n\n* **LangGraph:** Similar to Langchain, this keyword complements by referencing another relevant library, broadening the appeal to users researching specific tools. This expands the search scope while aligning perfectly with the video's topic. User value is increased by providing another tool.  Strategic importance lies in its niche relevance.\n\n* **Llama Index:**  This keyword acts as a complement by further expanding the list of relevant libraries mentioned in the video, broadening its appeal to users researching specific tools for AI agent development. The keyword enhances user value by providing another practical tool within the video's context. Its strategic importance is similar to Langchain and LangGraph.\n\n\n* **Generative AI applications:** This complements the primary keyword \u201cGenerative AI\u201d by focusing on the practical applications. Search broadening is achieved by attracting users who are interested in real-world examples. User value is added by detailing the usage scenarios, increasing user engagement.  Strategic importance stems from its relevance to practical aspects of Generative AI.\n\n* **Multimodal AI:** This keyword adds depth by incorporating a related yet broader concept touched upon in the video. Search broadening is significant as multimodal AI is a growing field. The user value is enhanced through this addition as it shows the capabilities of LLMs beyond simple text generation. Strategic importance comes from connecting to the advanced functionalities often found within Generative AI and Agentic AI systems."
