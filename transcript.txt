Nothing Phone 3 Review: They Lied!
(funky upbeat music)
- This is the Nothing Phone 3
and yeah, it's ugly.
(funky music)
You know, people say beauty is in the eye
of the beholder and stuff like that.
I get it. You can find
beauty in anything, for sure.
But also, you know,
there's a nice alignment
to things that feels good.
And you know, when things are,
when things are where
you expect them to be,
doesn't that feel better?
Okay. All right, carcinisation.
I learned about this recently.
This is a strange and
odd but funny phenomenon
and evolutionary biology where a bunch
of undersea crustaceans have
all slowly evolved towards
the same, flat, robust, crab-like shape
because it seems to be
the ideal form factor
for surviving in the ocean.
Oversimplified, it feels
like everything down there is
evolving towards a crab.
And look at all these crabs,
lots of smartphones today
basically look the same.
So when something that comes
along looks a little different,
well it's gonna feel weird, isn't it?
But hey, maybe someone's
into the layered glass look
with the text in various places.
Maybe you're into the
red dot turning into a
functional record light.
Maybe you're into a bit of a lobster.
Real talk though, it feels
like every few months Nothing
comes out with a new
product that looks crazy
and people hate on all the pictures
on the internet 'cause they look weird.
And then two months later
we're all used to it
and we forget about the looks
and we can focus on the product itself.
So let's just skip all that
and focus on the product.
This is what Nothing is calling
their first true flagship,
which is what you would
say if you're Nothing
and you're charging $799 for a
phone for the first time ever
after rolling around in the budget
and mid-range space for a few years.
But I've been using this
phone for the better part
of the last week and I'm gonna disagree
with the whole premise here actually.
This is no more of a
flagship phone than any
of Nothing's previous phones.
Now are they lying to us?
Eh, not exactly but kind of. Hear me out.
799 is the same price
as a Samsung Galaxy S25
or the Pixel 9, or right
underneath the iPhone 16.
Like they're competing against
bonafide flagships from mega
companies with basically unlimited money.
And part of what we've come
to expect from phones in this
class is basically giving
us the best available stuff.
Like it's kind of this unspoken rule,
but if you're spending
this much, you deserve
to just get the best parts, right?
That's why it's been so easy for me
to rag on like the Pixel in the past
for not having the best performance
or the iPhone for not having
a high refresh rate display.
So this Nothing Phone 3,
it's certainly dressed up like a flagship
and it is the most flagship
yet of any Nothing phone.
It is huge.
It's got this super bright,
high refresh rate, OLED display.
It has a massive new
silicon carbon battery,
new triple 50 megapixel
cameras, IP 68 certification,
up to 16 gigs of RAM.
Like it's got all the makings
of what could be a flagship.
But when you peel back the
mask, just a little bit,
like right under the surface,
it's the same exact strategy
that Nothing has been running on all their
previous phones in the past.
The playbook is
to just cut back just a little
bit from the highest end
stuff in ways that hopefully
you, the buyer, don't notice.
And it still feels like a flagship,
but that allows 'em to cut costs
and undercut the competition a little bit.
So it works. It's not a bad strategy.
It's allowed 'em to make
great phones in the past,
but it's just harder to sell
that strategy at this price.
So for starters, the chip inside, right?
It's not the expensive,
proven, powerful flagship
Snapdragon 8 Elite chip.
This is running the
Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 instead.
It's one of the first phones
we've seen using this chip.
And to be fair, it is much
better than anything we've seen
in any previous Nothing phone.
It's a four nanometer chip,
it's something like 40% better CPU
and like 90% better GPU than
the chip in the two year-old
Nothing Phone 2.
The phone is zippy and smooth as hell,
basically all the time.
And I'll get to the software
experience in a second.
But is it the best available?
Well, technically no.
The Snapdragon 8 Elite still smokes this.
You can see benchmark
scores, it's pretty clear
that's still the flagship chip.
Now you as the user
might never notice that.
In fact you probably wouldn't
if you just used the phone
side by side in a lot of
random, normal activities.
But if you happen to get into
graphically intensive gaming
or the most intense tasks,
that's what separates a flagship
from an upper mid-range chip.
So for some context, some
other phones using this chip,
the Poco F7 and the Iqoo Neo 10,
both of these are sub $500 phones.
I also think they were
very clever pairing it up
with 12 gigs of RAM and
256 gigs of storage base.
It's fast Ram, it's UFS 4.0
and then the upgraded
version for 899 is 16 gigs
of RAM and half a terabyte.
Awesome to see that. But
there is no 8 128 version.
And I think if they did make one,
that would probably be
like 699, but they didn't.
Now when we get to the outside
of this phone, there is this,
again, huge new AMOLED display.
Surely it's a flagship display, right?
It's gigantic.
It's 6.67 inches corner to corner
with perfectly even
bezels all the way around,
that takes extra work.
It's a gorgeous AMOLED,
nice color reproduction
and it's also, it's a
good amount over 1080P.
It's nice and sharp, smooth
with that dynamic refresh
rate up to 120 hertz
and it gets crazy bright,
1600 nits outdoors,
4,500 nits peak brightness with HDR.
So the numbers on paper go crazy
and it's just, it's such
a nice screen to look at.
I've loved using it. So
what's the catch, Marques?
Well one, you would
literally never know this
unless you check the spec sheet,
but the glass protecting
the front of this display,
it's Gorilla Glass 7i,
and that is a mid-range
glass in their lineup
where you might see flagships
using the more durable
Gorilla Glass Victus or Victus 2.
And normally I wouldn't even bring that up
but that's definitely something
to consider on a phone
that is meant to spend a
lot of its time face down.
And then another thing, there are a lot
of like really nice, subtle
things that go into this screen.
Like it has a 1,000
hertz touch sample rate,
so it's even more responsive
than the phone too.
It also has 2160 hertz PWM dimming
and it also has a very acceptable
optical fingerprint reader
down near the bottom.
But it's also an LTPS display,
instead of the most premium LTPO.
And all that really means
in practice is instead
of varying a refresh rate
from one to 120 hertz,
it can go from 30 to 120 hertz.
You would never notice, but
it does mean a little bit
worse power efficiency.
I'll tell you what though, it
can actually absolutely handle
the slightly worse power efficiency
because the battery in
this phone is elite.
It's marketed as a 5100
50 milliamp power battery,
but according to Nothing
and it gets complicated
but it's actually rated at a
5,500 milliamp power battery.
It's silicon carbon, it
charges extra fast at 65 watts.
It supports wireless charging,
reverse wireless charging,
reverse wired charging.
It's great.
It sips power in standby
and it's genuinely a two day
phone if you want it to be,
even without the more
efficient Snapdragon 8 Elite.
So honestly flagship battery for sure.
So then, okay, what about the cameras?
Triple 50 megapixel cameras
feels pretty flagship.
And you know what, again, it is closer
to a flagship than any previous
Nothing phone has ever been,
